##(Data over Ultrasonics)

## What it does ?

Connectionless ultrasonic message transfer.

Using ultrasonic communication as a covert channel in consumer electronics products.Researching into sustaining a transmission rate of 1 byte per second for arbitrary binary data, and to obtained up to 99.5% accuracy when broadcasting across 0 feet, and up to 81.6% accuracy when broadcasting across 10 feet.

This project demonstrates that for small messages ultrasonic communication is quite feasible using standard microphones and speakers shipped in consumer electronics.

We then are currenltly exploring the limitations of this type of communication as well as potential use cases for surveillance and countermeasures in a cyber security led research project.

The project is inspired from below mentioned articles and relative findings.

## Purpose

- Computer speakers and headphones make passable microphones and can be used to receive data via ultrasonic sound and send signals back, making the practice of air gapping sensitive computer systems less secure.

- Surveillance and Countermeasures

## What's here?
